# üß† Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on **Machine Learning** projects.  
This repository contains small to mid-scale ML projects built to help me learn and apply practical AI/ML concepts ‚Äî from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

> üöÄ *Learn by building. Improve by experimenting.*

## üéØ Goal

The purpose of this repository is to apply machine learning techniques to real datasets, build predictive models, and enhance my knowledge in AI/ML through hands-on projects ‚Äî not only by using existing solutions, but also by creating my own predictive models to truly understand how they work.

## üìÇ Projects

### üë®‚Äçüíº [Adult Income Prediction](https://github.com/Bukvsky/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Adult-Income-dataset)  
A classification model predicting whether a person's income exceeds \$50K/year based on census data.  
Key elements:
- Data cleaning & EDA (age, education, occupation, etc.)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Train/test split & various classifiers
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

### ‚ö°Ô∏è [Energy Consumption ‚Äì Linear Regression](https://github.com/Bukvsky/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Energy%20Consumption%20Dataset%20-%20Linear%20Regression)  
A regression project forecasting energy consumption using features from building data (e.g., smart meter readings).  
Key elements:
- Correlation analysis & visualization
- Preprocessing of time-series features
- Linear regression modeling
- Model evaluation: R¬≤, MAE, RMSE

### üíº [Salary Prediction](https://github.com/Bukvsky/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Salary%20Dataset)  
A regression model predicting salary levels based on job-related features (education, experience, location).  
Key elements:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature encoding (one‚Äëhot, label encoding)
- Model training: linear regression (plus others)
- Validation using RMSE and R¬≤
